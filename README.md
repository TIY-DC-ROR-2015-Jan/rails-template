# Rails Template

Codifies several of the boilerplate setup steps we follow for most (if not all) of our Rails apps. See `template.rb` for full details, but it should at least:

* Remove `turbolinks`
* Install common gems
* Install and configure `devise`
* Create a `User` model
* Install and configure `rspec-rails`
* Initialize a `git` repo and make the initial commit
